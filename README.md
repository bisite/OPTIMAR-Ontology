# OPTiMAR ontology - offshore wind platform

Repository containing the OPTiMAR ontology for offshore wind platforms, including definitions, instances, and usage examples.  
The ontology models platform components, turbines, sensors, failures, maintenance activities, actors, roles, and environmental conditions, supporting semantic interoperability and reasoning for monitoring and operational planning.

- `instances/` : full instantiations aligned with each ontology version.
- `scripts/` : auxiliary scripts for validation, SPARQL queries, or ontology processing.
- `docs/` : ontology documentation, diagrams, and metadata.
- `LICENSE` : repository license file.
- `README.md` : this file.

Each version of the ontology is stored in a separate file with its own namespace IRI.  
Full instances for each version are stored under the `instances/` directory.

## Ontology IRI and usage

For version 2.1:

- Ontology TTL: `https://bisite.github.io/OPTIMAR-Ontology/ontology/OPTiMAR-v2.1.ttl`
- Instances TTL: `https://bisite.github.io/OPTIMAR-Ontology/instances/v2.1/instances.ttl`

The ontology uses the following common prefixes:

```turtle
@prefix optimar: <https://bisite.github.io/OPTIMAR-Ontology/ontology/v2.1/OPTiMAR-v2.1.ttl#> .
@prefix sosa: <https://www.w3.org/ns/sosa/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
