# OPTiMAR ontology - offshore wind platform

Repository containing the OPTiMAR ontology for offshore wind platforms, including definitions, instances, and usage examples.  
The ontology models platform components, turbines, sensors, failures, maintenance activities, actors, roles, and environmental conditions, supporting semantic interoperability and reasoning for monitoring and operational planning.
